// Implement an Event Scheduler with Dynamic Priorities
//
// You are tasked with building an event scheduler for a simulation system. In this system:
// 	•	Each Event has the following attributes:
// 	•	ID: A unique identifier (integer).
// 	•	Priority: An integer where a higher value means higher priority.
// 	•	Timestamp: The time at which the event is scheduled to occur (integer).
// 	•	Duration: The time it takes to process the event (integer).
// 	•	Dependencies: A list of event IDs that must be processed before this event can be processed.
//
// Requirements:
// 	1.	Process Events in Priority Order:
// 	•	Events should be processed based on their priority.
// 	•	If two events have the same priority, the one with the earlier timestamp should be processed first.
// 	•	If both priority and timestamp are the same, the event with the smaller ID should be processed first.
// 	2.	Dynamic Priority Updates:
// 	•	Some events can change priority during the simulation.
// 	•	When an event’s priority changes, the scheduler must reorder the events to maintain the correct processing order.
// 	3.	Dependency Handling:
// 	•	An event cannot be processed until all its dependencies have been processed.
// 	•	If an event’s dependencies are not yet processed, it remains in the queue.
// 	4.	Implement Using std::make_heap and Related Functions:
// 	•	Use std::make_heap, std::push_heap, std::pop_heap, and std::sort_heap to manage the event queue.
// 	•	Do not use std::priority_queue.
// 	5.	Simulation Flow:
// 	•	Initialize the event queue with a set of events.
// 	•	At each simulation step:
// 	•	Update event priorities if necessary.
// 	•	Process events that are ready (dependencies met) and scheduled for the current timestamp.
// 	•	Advance the simulation timestamp.
// 	6.	Output:
// 	•	Print the order in which events are processed, including their ID, priority, timestamp, and duration.

    int priority;                           // Priority (higher value = higher priority)
    int timestamp;                          // Scheduled time
    int duration;                           // Processing duration
    std::vector<int> dependencies;          // List of event IDs that must be processed before this event
